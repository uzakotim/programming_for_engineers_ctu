Every single time I read Programming Pearls, this passage brings me up short:

    Binary search solves the problem [of searching within a pre-sorted array] 
	by keeping track of a range within the array in which T 
	[i.e. the sought value] must be if it is anywhere in the array.  
	Initially, the range is the entire array.  
	The range is shrunk by comparing its middle element to T 
	and discarding half the range.  The process continues until T is 
	discovered in the array, or until the range in which it must lie 
	is known to be empty.
	In an N-element table, the search uses roughly log2(N) comparisons.

    Most programmers think that with the above description in hand, 
	writing the code is easy; theyre wrong.  
	The only way youll believe this is by putting down 
	this column right now and writing the code yourself.  Try it.

    Ive assigned this problem in courses at Bell Labs and IBM.  
	Professional programmers had a couple of hours to convert the above 
	description into a program in the language of their choice; 
	a high-level pseudocode was fine.  At the end of the specified time, 
	almost all the programmers reported that they had correct code 
	for the task.  We would then take thirty minutes to examine 
	their code, which the programmers did with test cases.  
	In several classes and with over a hundred programmers, 
	the results varied little: ninety percent of the programmers found 
	bugs in their programs (and I wasnt always convinced of the correctness
	 of the code in which no bugs were found).

    I was amazed: given ample time, 
	only about ten percent of professional programmers were able 
	to get this small program right.  But they arent the only ones 
	to find this task difficult: in the history in Section 6.2.1 
	of his Sorting and Searching, Knuth points out that while the 
	first binary search was published in 1946, 
	the first published binary search without bugs did not appear until 1962.
